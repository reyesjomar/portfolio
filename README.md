# Jomar Reyes – Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! I'm a data analyst with a background in Kinesiology, bringing a human-centered approach to data storytelling. I use tools like SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python to turn data into actionable insights that drive smarter decisions.

This portfolio includes projects developed through my training, bootcamps, and client simulations. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems using clean, well-documented code and visualizations.
