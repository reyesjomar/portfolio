# A Comparative Analysis of Maximalist and Traditional Running Shoes

## Overview
Examined whether there is a change in kinematics in relation to the type of shoe: maximalist or traditional an individual wears when running.

## Tools Used
- Excel
- Vicon Motion Capture

## Key Outcomes
1. Higher Knee Varus in Maximalist Shoes
- Participants wearing maximalist shoes showed greater peak knee varus (7.73°) compared to traditional shoes (7.35°), suggesting a higher risk of knee joint injury due to medial overloading.
2. Increased Ankle Eversion with Maximalist Shoes
- Ankle eversion was higher in maximalist shoes (7.60° vs. 6.67°), which, while within normal range, could increase stress on the foot and raise the risk of conditions like plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendinitis.
3. Lower Loading Rate in Maximalist Shoes:
- Maximalist shoes reduced loading rate during running (57.3 BW/s vs. 75.7 BW/s in traditional shoes), indicating better shock absorption and potentially lower impact-related injury risk.
