# A Comparative Analysis of Maximalist and Traditional Running Shoes

## Project Summary

This project examines the biomechanical impact of maximalist versus traditional running shoes by analyzing three key variables: knee varus angle, ankle eversion, and loading rate. The goal was to assess whether maximalist shoes provide measurable benefits in reducing running-related injury risk.

The data showed that maximalist shoes, while offering better shock absorption through a lower loading rate, also resulted in higher knee varus and increased ankle eversion — both of which are associated with greater risk for injuries such as knee joint deterioration, plantar fasciitis, and tendonitis.

Although maximalist shoes feature increased cushioning, this study found no consistent biomechanical advantage over traditional running shoes. The findings suggest that footwear choice should be based on personal comfort, biomechanics, and injury history, rather than assumptions about shoe design.

## Overview
Examined whether there is a change in kinematics in relation to the type of shoe: maximalist or traditional an individual wears when running.

---

## Tools Used
- **Excel** (Data cleaning and organization)
- **Vicon Motion Capture** (Captured real-time kinematic measurements during running trials)

---

## Key Outcomes
1. **Higher Knee Varus in Maximalist Shoes**
Participants wearing maximalist shoes showed greater peak knee varus (**7.73°**) compared to traditional shoes (**7.35°**), suggesting a higher risk of knee joint injury due to medial overloading.
2. **Increased Ankle Eversion with Maximalist Shoes**
Ankle eversion was higher in maximalist shoes (**7.60°** vs. **6.67°**), which, while within normal range, could increase stress on the foot and raise the risk of conditions like plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendinitis.
3. **Lower Loading Rate in Maximalist Shoes**
Maximalist shoes reduced loading rate during running (**57.3 BW/s** vs. **75.7 BW/s** in traditional shoes), indicating better shock absorption and potentially lower impact-related injury risk.

## Conclusion
While maximalist running shoes are often marketed for their enhanced cushioning and injury-prevention benefits, this analysis found no consistent biomechanical advantage over traditional running shoes. 

- **Knee varus angles** and **ankle eversion** were both higher in maximalist shoes, suggesting a potential increase in injury risk, particularly for the knee joint and lower leg tendons. 
- However, **loading rate was lower** in maximalist shoes, indicating **better shock absorption** during heel strike.

These mixed outcomes highlight that shoe selection should be based on individual biomechanics, comfort, and running habits rather than assuming one shoe type is inherently better. More research and personalized assessments are recommended for long-term injury prevention.
