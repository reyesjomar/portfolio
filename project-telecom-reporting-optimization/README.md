# Telecom Reporting Optimization

## Summary

This project was developed for a telecommunications client seeking data-driven insights to optimize their digital advertising strategy. We analyzed ad performance across three core dimensions: Creative, Audience, and Inventory, using a variety of performance and branding KPIs such as CPA, CPC, CVR, CPM, CTR, and Viewability.

Our goal was to benchmark creative sizes, audience segments, and publishers against client objectives, and deliver actionable recommendations for budget reallocation and strategic improvement. 

The analysis revealed clear performance trends by device type and ad format, highlighted high-performing audience personas, and exposed underperforming inventory. This allowed us to provide specific, data-supported strategies to increase ROI and ad efficiency.

## Overview

We evaluated ad performance data for a telecom company with a focus on:
- Creative Size & Messaging
- Audience Segmentation & Propensity
- Inventory and Publisher Performance

Each category was assessed using both performance metrics (CPA, CPC, CPM, CVR) and branding metrics (CTR, Viewability, Viewable Impressions), compared against industry benchmarks and client goals.

## Key Outcomes

1. **High-Performing Creative Sizes**  
   Mobile (320x50) and Desktop (300x250) ad sizes had the best overall performance in CPA, CVR, and CPC. Larger mobile ads were associated with higher ROI and lower cost-per-action.

2. **Audience Segment Insights**  
   Top audience segments included: Life Event, Finance, and Travel. These audiences consistently delivered lower CPA and higher engagement, making them ideal for targeted ad spend.

3. **Publisher Optimization**  
   Publishers such as outlook.live.com, historycollection.com, and mail.aol.com exceeded viewability benchmarks (>60%) and offered cost-effective CPM rates for direct buy opportunities.

## Conclusion

Through a detailed analysis of creative formats, audience segments, and publisher performance, we identified clear opportunities to improve ad efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

- 320x50 (mobile) and 300x250 (desktop) ad sizes should receive higher budget allocation.
- The most impactful audiences for conversion and engagement were Life Event, Finance, and Travel.
- Direct buys should prioritize high-performing, viewable publishers offering CPMs within the $10–20 range.

This project provides a blueprint for data-backed ad optimization and demonstrates how performance analytics can guide strategic media investment.
