# New York City Evictions – Data Analysis Project

## Project Summary

This project explores eviction trends in **New York City** over the past seven years, with a focus on identifying key causes, patterns, and the distinction between **legal possession** and **evictions**. Using public data and contextual research, we analyze how socioeconomic factors like the **pandemic**, **underemployment**, **inflation**, and **housing pressure from Airbnb properties** have contributed to tenant displacement across residential zones.

## Key Outcomes

1. **Spike in Evictions Post-2022**  
   A sharp increase in evictions occurred in 2022, correlating with post-pandemic economic pressure and job insecurity.

2. **Residential Areas Are Most Affected**  
   Evictions were significantly more common in **residential zones** than commercial ones, especially in lower-income neighborhoods.

3. **Legal Possession > Traditional Eviction**  
   The data revealed a **greater number of legal possessions** than formal evictions, suggesting that many removals occur through legal channels less visible in standard eviction metrics.

4. **NYC vs. LA Comparison**  
   The **eviction rate in NYC was lower** compared to Los Angeles, despite similar economic stressors.

## Conclusion

Evictions in NYC are deeply tied to structural issues like economic instability, housing costs, and pandemic recovery.
