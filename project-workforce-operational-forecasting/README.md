# Workforce & Operational Forecasting – City of Milpitas

## Summary

This project was developed for the City of Milpitas’ Recreation and Community Services Department to support data-informed staffing decisions and fiscal planning. By analyzing over 3,000 building attendant timesheets across five city-operated facilities, we uncovered patterns in workforce utilization and projected an 18% increase in labor costs based on proposed operational changes.

Our objective was to model the financial impact of extending weekday shifts and to provide actionable labor forecasting to assist department leadership with FY25 budget alignment.

The analysis surfaced critical trends in labor allocation, revealed cost drivers by facility and day of week, and supported a strategic shift in staffing plans.

## Overview

We evaluated operational labor data for city recreation facilities with a focus on:

Timesheet Volume and Labor Trends

Forecasting Labor Cost Increases

Budget Modeling for Proposed Shift Extensions

Each analysis incorporated historical patterns, cost rates, and operational hours to model future impact and provide decision-ready insights.

## Tools Used

- Excel (Data transformation, cost modeling, pivot tables)
- SQL (Data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation of time entry records)

---

## Data Sources
- City of Milpitas Timesheet Data (3,000+ records across multiple facilities)
- Internal Wage and Budget Guidelines

## Key Outcomes

1. **Projected Labor Cost Increase**  
   Modeling indicated an 18% increase in overall labor costs due to proposed weekday shift extensions, primarily affecting after-school and evening hours.

2. **Forecasting by Facility**  
   Cost impact varied across facilities; two centers showed disproportionate increases tied to youth programming and gym rental traffic.

3. **Budget Realignment Recommendations**  
   Presented findings to the Director of Recreation and Community Services. Insights directly contributed to realignment of staffing plans and reallocation of the FY25 operating budget.
